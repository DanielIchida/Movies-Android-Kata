# Movies-Android-Kata Part4
Movies Android kata for practice Best Practices in Android implemented by Jorge Sánchez (Xurxodev)

Kata 4

- We are here to practice UI Testing.
- We are going to use [espresso](https://google.github.io/android-testing-support-library/docs) to interact with the Application UI.
- We are going to practice pair programming.

## Considerations

Master branch contains already solved katas, exists a branch for every kata.

## Getting started

This repository contains an Android application to show movies information:

Initial state in this branch is ready to just start writing UI tests.

## Tasks

Your task as Android Developer is to **create Espresso tests**.

The recommendation for this exercise is:

  * Before starting
    1. Fork this repository and Checkout `kata_espresso_movies` branch or download zip.
    2. Execute the application, explore it manually and make yourself familiar with the code.
  
  * Test to create:
    1. Create a test that navigate to all detail movies activity and verify title as movie title
    2. Create a test that verify the number of rows is equal than movies count text
    3. Create a test that verify that while is retrieving movies loading text is visible
    4. Create a test that verify that while is retrieving movies progress bar is visible
    
  * Rules
    1. First create tests without Robot Pattern
    2. After refactoring tests to Robot Pattern
